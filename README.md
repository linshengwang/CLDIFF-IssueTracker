### TODOs

* Documentation of CLDiff

### How to start
1. start CLDiff in command line mode:
    * Run CLDiff in main.CLDIFFCmd.java
    * As you can see in CLDIFFCmd.run(),CLDiff accepts three arguments: repository path(ends with "/.git"), commit id and CLDiff cache directory(/foo/bar).
2. start CLDiff with CLDiff-Web
    * Deploy [CLDiff-Web](https://github.com/FudanSELab/CLDIFF-WEB) to web container(e.g. Tomcat)
    * In CLDiff, run main.CLDIFFServerOffline.java. Remember to pass two arguments: repository path(ends with "/.git") and CLDiff cache directory(/foo/bar).
    * Enter http://localhost:8080/indexoffline.html in your browser. Start with one commit id.
